## **Project Disclaimer & Important Notes**

The analysis compares the financial performance and risk-adjusted returns of ESG-listed versus non-ESG companies in Thailand’s Petrochemicals & Chemicals sector over the period 2018–2025, using publicly available data from yfinance and the Stock Exchange of Thailand’s official Thai ESG list.

Key caveats that significantly affect the reliability of the conclusions:
- Extremely small sample size (only ~12 companies total, split into two groups of roughly 5–7 each), making statistical tests underpowered and results highly sensitive to individual company performance.
- Reliance on yfinance for historical prices and fundamental data, which is known to have gaps, delays, and occasional inaccuracies for non-US stocks, especially Thai securities.
- Short observation window (maximum 7.5 years), insufficient to capture long-term ESG benefits that typically emerge over 10–20-year horizons.
- Analysis limited to a single, highly cyclical and commodity-driven sector (petrochemicals), where ESG practices may not yet translate into measurable financial outperformance.

As a result, the finding of “no statistically significant difference” between ESG and non-ESG companies should be interpreted as absence of evidence in this specific, limited setting — not as evidence that ESG investing has no value in Thailand.
